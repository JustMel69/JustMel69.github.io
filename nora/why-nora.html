<h2 id="why-though">Why though</h2>
<p>You see, I don’t really like most commercial game engines. I’m just
like that, I’m a hater, that’s why I thought I would be better off
building my own solution.</p>
<h3 id="just-use-unity">“Just use Unity”</h3>
<p>I used to like Unity, like, a LOT. I started learning Unity in 2020
after I unplugged my dying GPU from my computer and used it up until
Godot 4.0 came out.</p>
<p>Funny story, at that time I thought my dedicated GPU fully died and
it was my integrated GPU’s fault that I was locked in low screen
resolutions and <em>incompatible driver</em> hell, but no! When I
disconnected my dedicated GPU I discovered that my integrated GPU was
not to blame, but instead it was the other bitch being a nuisance and
locking me into only being able to run RPG Maker to scratch my game
development itch. I could even use <a
href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> once I extirpated that GPU
from the machine she was parasitizing.</p>
<p>That aside, I don’t trust Unity anymore, for obvious reasons like the
<strong><a
href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/game-developers-unite-against-unitys-new-per-install-pricing-structure/">install
fees</a></strong> they tried to implement. And yes, I know they got a
new CEO and shit, but I’m sure their rotting has taken roots and will
rise again any day now.</p>
<h3 id="just-use-unreal">“Just use Unreal”</h3>
<p>You see, I don’t really fancy <strong>100+ GB games with Ultra
Photorealistic Graphics that require the newest Nvidia GPU to run at
60fps</strong> (if they even run at 60fps to begin with).</p>
<p>Now here’s the thing, I’m a REAL Unreal Engine hater. I dislike
<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/M00DGjAP-mU">Nanite and it’s horrible
overdraw problem</a></strong>, I dislike <strong><a
href="https://youtu.be/lJu_DgCHfx4">TAA and the over-reliance many UE’s
visual effects have on it</a></strong>, and I just straight up don’t
like it personally. I genuinely think Unreal Engine is the worst symptom
of the current state of the industry.</p>
<h3 id="just-use-godot">“Just use Godot”</h3>
<p>You see, I used to really like Godot when I first started with it
back when 4.0 dropped. Nowadays, I feel like the design principles of
the engine just generate too much friction with my way of thinking. I’m
not saying it’s a bad engine, I think it’s a really good engine in fact;
I just don’t vibe with it enough to commit to it for any real
project.</p>
<h3 id="just-use-insert-obscure-game-engine-here">“Just use [Insert
obscure Game Engine here]”</h3>
<p>I’m sure this random engine you’re recommending me is really cool and
could work for me if I gave it the time, but the whole <strong>Unity
conundrum</strong> has spawned a unitillion new Game Engines and I only
have 24 hours in my days, can’t test them all.</p>
<h2 id="ok-but-why-though">Ok but why though</h2>
<p>Other than everything I’ve already said, I just like building
software from the ground up and knowing how every gear turns inside my
glorious creations gives me a sense of security and control I really
enjoy.</p>
<p>Also, it’s fun (except when dealing with matrices).</p>
