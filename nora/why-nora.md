## Why though

You see, I don't really like most commercial game engines. I'm just like that, I'm a hater, that's why I thought I would be better off building my own solution.

### "Just use Unity"

I used to like Unity, like, a LOT. I started learning Unity in 2020 after I unplugged my dying GPU from my computer and used it up until Godot 4.0 came out.

Funny story, at that time I thought my dedicated GPU fully died and it was my integrated GPU's fault that I was locked in low screen resolutions and _incompatible driver_ hell, but no! When I disconnected my dedicated GPU I discovered that my integrated GPU was not to blame, but instead it was the other bitch being a nuisance and locking me into only being able to run RPG Maker to scratch my game development itch. I could even use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) once I extirpated that GPU from the machine she was parasitizing.

That aside, I don't trust Unity anymore, for obvious reasons like the **[install fees](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/game-developers-unite-against-unitys-new-per-install-pricing-structure/)** they tried to implement. And yes, I know they got a new CEO and shit, but I'm sure their rotting has taken roots and will rise again any day now.

### "Just use Unreal"

You see, I don't really fancy **100+ GB games with Ultra Photorealistic Graphics that require the newest Nvidia GPU to run at 60fps** (if they even run at 60fps to begin with).

Now here's the thing, I'm a REAL Unreal Engine hater. I dislike **[Nanite and it's horrible overdraw problem](https://youtu.be/M00DGjAP-mU)**, I dislike **[TAA and the over-reliance many UE's visual effects have on it](https://youtu.be/lJu_DgCHfx4)**, and I just straight up don't like it personally. I genuinely think Unreal Engine is the worst symptom of the current state of the industry.

### "Just use Godot"

You see, I used to really like Godot when I first started with it back when 4.0 dropped. Nowadays, I feel like the design principles of the engine just generate too much friction with my way of thinking. I'm not saying it's a bad engine, I think it's a really good engine in fact; I just don't vibe with it enough to commit to it for any real project.

### "Just use [Insert obscure Game Engine here]"

I'm sure this random engine you're recommending me is really cool and could work for me if I gave it the time, but the whole **Unity conundrum** has spawned a unitillion new Game Engines and I only have 24 hours in my days, can't test them all.

## Ok but why though

Other than everything I've already said, I just like building software from the ground up and knowing how every gear turns inside my glorious creations gives me a sense of security and control I really enjoy.

Also, it's fun (except when dealing with matrices).
