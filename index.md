## About

This little corner here basically exists to document whatever the hell I'm doing.

I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a web dev, so this little webpage wouldn't have been possible without [Oskar Wickstr√∂m's "The Monospace Web"](https://github.com/owickstrom/the-monospace-web)!

## What I'm doing now

I'm currently working on:

- An **In-house 3D Game Engine** called **[Nora](nora.html)**.
- An **Open Source 2D Game Development Framework** called **[Nogine](nogine.html)**.
- A **JRPG inspired videogame** developed with **Nogine** (codename "Arpeegee" (don't really have any other name)).
- A computer science degree (not important here).

## How to help

I don't know, be nice to me. I'm a sensitive girl.
