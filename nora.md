## What is Nora

**Nora** (name inspired by [Noragami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noragami)) is an In-house 3D Game Engine using **[Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)** and the **[Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** (yeah I know).

Nora is currently on her infancy but I promise to *sometimes* update you about her (yeah, she's a her, my engine my rules).
