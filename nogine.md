## What is Nogine

**Nogine** (**NO** en**GINE**) is an Open Source Game Development Framework using **[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)** and the **[Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**, with as few dependencies as possible (working on it).

Nogine is currently only being used on my game **"Arpeegee"**, so it's currently dirty and unfinished. Use it at your own discretion, I can't ensure any kind of stability.
